### Major desktop environments

* KDE
* Gnome
* Xfce

#### KDE

KDE is an international free software community. Well know products include the __Plasma Desktop__ (default desktop environment on many Linux distributions).

KDE Plasma can be adjusted to run on various form factors like desktops, netbooks, tablets and smartphones or even embedded devices.

#### Gnome

GNOME is a free and open-source desktop environment for Unix-like OS. It is part of the _GNU Project_ and developed by _The GNOME Project_ which is composed of both volunteers and paid contributors, the largest corporate contributor being _Red Hat_. It is an international project that aims to devleop software frameworks for the development of software, to program end-user applications based on these frameworks, and to coordinate efforts for internationalization, localization and accessibility of that software.

GNOME is the default desktop environment on many major Linux distributions including Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu, SUSE Linux Enterprise, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Pop!_OS, Oracle Linux, SteamOS, Tails, Endless OS, and Solaris. And is provided as an official edition by Manjaro. The continued fork of the last GNOME 2 release, called MATE, is default on many Linux distros that target low usage of system resources.

#### Xfce

Free and open-source desktop environment for Linux and BSD OS.

Xfce aims to be fast and lightweight while still being visually appealing and easy to use. Xfce embodies the traditional Unix philosohpy of modularity and re-usability. It consists of separately packaged parts that together provide all functions of the desktop environment, but can be selected in subsets to suit user needs and preference. Another priority of Xfce is adherence to standards, specifically those defined at [freedesktop](freedesktop.org).

Like GNOME, Xfce is based on the GTK toolkit, but it is not a GNOME fork.

### Protocols to access remote desktop dessions

* X11 (See previous topic)
* XDMCP: X Display Manager Control Protocol
* VNC: Virtual Network Computing
* Spice: Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments
* RDP: Remote Desktop Protocol

#### XDMCP: X Display Manager Control Protocol 

XDMCP is designed to provide authenticated access to display management services for remote displays.

Provide a uniform mechanism for an autonomous display to request login service from a remote host. By autonomous, we mean the display consists of hardware and processes that are independent of any particular host where login service is desired.

#### VNC: Virtual Network Computing

Graphical desktop-sharing system that uses the _Remote Frame Buffer Protocol (RFB)_ to remotely control another computer. It transmists the keyboard and mouse events fron one computer to another, relaying the graphical-screen updates back in the other direction, over a network.

VNC is platform-independent.

#### Spice: Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments

Remote-display system built for virtual environments which allows users to view a computing "desktop" environment, not only on its computer-server machine, but also from anywhere on the Internet, using a wide variety of machine architectures.

#### RDP: Remote Desktop Protocol 

Proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft which provides a user with a graphical interface to connect to another computer over a network connection. The user employs RDP client software for this purpose, while the other computer must run RDP server software.
